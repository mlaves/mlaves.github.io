I"±<p>The â€œHouse of Santa Clauseâ€ is a famous german drawing game and riddle. My grandfather introduced it to me when I was a little child. Its task is to draw a â€œhouseâ€ with exactly 8 lines without lifting the pen or drawing a line twice. The drawing is accompanied by the simultaneously spoken rhyme of 8 syllables: â€œThis is the house of San-ta Clausâ€, or in the german original â€œDas ist das Haus vom Ni-ko-lausâ€.</p>
