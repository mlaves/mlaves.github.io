    title: About me
    summary: |
      Modern medicine has made incredible progress in the last 100 years. The development of technology to support medical personnel has contributed to this in particular. It is my wish to do research on data-driven medical technology of tomorrow and to support modern medicine with my contribution. I am a research assistant and fifth year PhD student at the Institute of Mechatronic Systems, Leibniz Universität Hannover, Germany and are currently interested in approximate Bayesian inference for uncertainty-aware medical image analysis. The working title of my PhD thesis is *Well-Calibrated Predictive Uncertainty in Medical Imaging with Deep Learning*, which I expect to finish by 12/2020.

      After finishing my PhD thesis, I take on new challenges and start as a PostDoc at the [Institute of Medical Technology and Intelligent Systems](https://mtec.et8.tuhh.de) with Prof. Alexander Schlaefer.
